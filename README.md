My Son is huge into Fortnite as am i honestly!  Its a fun game we can play together and he loves playing with his friends.  As im sure many of you know!!!  This is one of my first projects with my new Maslow and i love it!  It took quite a few hours to run.  I ran into a slight bump issue on the O but just a little chisel fixed the issue and i was good to go!  This is my first project upload and first time uploading to GitHub so bare with any missing info!!

## Materials
* 4x8 1/2" MDF

A few hours into the Cut and all is well!  You can see on the first O that theres some left over that got missed on what i think we just a catch in the chain but i wasnt in the room to be certain!

So one of the things i know about MDF is its lovely ability to take in water and then destroy itself!  So i read that lot of cabinet makings will seal the edges on MDF with some drywall Joint Compound.  So i began the lovely task of running a thin seal around all the cut edges of the sign.  This was all the edges so that was fun, and then i put some mud in the letters since i carved into the MDF and had lots of little fuzzy parts.  This mud created a nice seal and solved the problem of the fuzzies ruining the paint job.

First purple coat has gone on!  I put another coat of purple and then ran a smooth roller over the edges with black to catch any of the purple that bled over.  I used a small brush to get the corners situated and then painted all the edges black.
