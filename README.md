# Fortnite Sign

My Son is huge into Fortnite as am i honestly!  Its a fun game we can play together and he loves playing with his friends.  As im sure many of you know!!!  This is one of my first projects with my new Maslow and i love it!  It took quite a few hours to run.  I ran into a slight bump issue on the O but just a little chisel fixed the issue and i was good to go!  This is my first project upload and first time uploading to GitHub so bare with any missing info!!
